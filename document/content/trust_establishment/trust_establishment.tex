\chapter{Trust Establishment}

Here in the book we want to distinguish an adversary and an enemy. Adversarial cooperation, but an enemy is not. 

Deffie-Hellman is vulnerable to Man-In-The-Middle attacks. 

Therefore the current. layout a protocol using Zero-Knowledge-Proofs able to stablish trust. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item An enemy in the middle might do a denial of service attack, we here are trying to protect against active eavedropping attacks. 
    \item How can an enemy proof something it does not know. 
    \item The enemy cannot change the challenge, in which case the retrived proof would not be valid to what is expected. 
\end{enumerate}

Solve this, for it is a grail in cryptography. 

However intution tells me, the protocol needs to be form of extensive chanllenge steps to overthorw the enemy.
