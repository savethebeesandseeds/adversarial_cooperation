\chapter{Tic-Tac-Toe without revealing the strategy}

A perfect strategy in Tic-Tak-Toe is an undefeaded one, (one that might wins or ties any games). 

Here is a way to proof your adversay that you know the perfect stratgy, without 
revealing the strategy. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item commit to a session seed. 
    \item avoid the adversay from clonning the strategy. 
    \item proof loop (warning, a loop permits adversarial clonning)
        \item adversay select the initial conditions
        \item proof of undefeated all the montecarlo scenarios
        \item proof that you can invert the matrix
\end{enumerate}

always include codes for demonstration.
